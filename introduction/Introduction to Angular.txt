Introduction to Angular

Angular was developed and is maintained by Google. It was created by a team of engineers at Google, led by Misko Hevery, and was first released as "AngularJS" in 2010.

AngularJS (version 1.x) was introduced in 2010. In 2016, Angular 2 was released as a complete rewrite of AngularJS. Since then, Angular has been updated regularly with new versions, on an average every within year. Current latest versions of angular is 19 active.

Why was it introduced? 
Angular was created to address the challenges in building dynamic web applications. The primary reasons for its introduction were:

1:) Simplified Development: It provided a framework that made it easier to build rich, single-page applications (SPAs).
2:) MVC Architecture: Angular follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which helps organize code more efficiently.
3:) Two-way Data Binding: This feature automatically updates the view whenever the model changes and vice versa, making data management smoother.
4:) Reusability: Components in Angular can be reused, allowing developers to build scalable applications efficiently.
5:) Dependency Injection: Angular introduced dependency injection for easier testing and better component interaction.
6:) Rich Ecosystem: Angular offers a comprehensive set of tools, including CLI (Command Line Interface), which streamlines tasks like testing, building, and deploying.

Angular vs React:

Architecture: Angular is a full-fledged framework, while React is a library focused on building UI components.
Learning Curve: Angular has a steeper learning curve due to its large set of features and complete structure. React, being simpler, has a gentler learning curve.
State Management: Angular has built-in solutions for state management, while React relies on external libraries like Redux.
Performance: React has better performance in many cases because it focuses on the view layer, but Angular is highly optimized with features like change detection.

Why should we use Angular?

Comprehensive Framework: Angular provides a complete package, offering everything from routing and form handling to HTTP requests, making it a one-stop solution for building modern web applications.
Strong Community and Google Support: Angular has a large community and strong backing from Google, ensuring consistent updates, bug fixes, and long-term support.
TypeScript: Angular is built with TypeScript, which offers better tooling, enhanced code quality, and debugging capabilities.
Modular and Scalable: Angular's component-based architecture allows for reusable, modular code, making it scalable for large applications.
Built-in Tools: Angular comes with its own CLI, which simplifies many tasks like scaffolding, testing, and building, saving developers time.
Enterprise-Level Applications: Angular is widely used for building complex, enterprise-level applications due to its robustness and scalability.
